# This file tells Git which files and directories to ignore.
# These rules apply to all subdirectories (HW1, HW2, etc.).

# 1. Compiled Executables
# These are the specific output files from Makefiles.
# We will add the executable name for each assignment here.
**/filter   # From HW1
# (e.g., Add '**/hashtable' here when we do HW2)
# (e.g., Add '**/matmul' here when we do HW3)


# 2. Object files
# This is a generic pattern for intermediate compilation files.
**/*.o


# 3. Output, Log, and Temporary Files
# These are generic patterns for files generated by running the code
# or for backup purposes.
#
# NOTE: We DO NOT ignore 'input.txt' or 'input.bin' as they are
# required source files to run the assignments.

# Specific output files
**/out.txt
**/err.txt
**/log.txt
**/Output.txt
**/output.bin

# Ignore Condor/backup files
**/*.cmd

# Ignore all 'ori-' prefixed files in all subdirectories
**/ori-*
# Specific rule for 'ori-README.md' which is not caught by the generic rule
**/ori-README.md


# 4. OS-specific files
# Generic pattern for macOS metadata
**/.DS_Store


# 5. IDE Configuration Files
# Generic patterns for IDE settings
**/.vscode/
**/.idea/
